your Hot 97and I have some Idon't wanna say goodbut interesting newsabout the robbery.There are two new suspects.A Stanley Fisher and a BrookeJohnson have been arrested.They are also beingcharged with two murdersbehind the robbery of the bank,but out of all that moneythey only had $20,000 left.This is the crazy part.They had the policelooking for a Daniel Key,but the police said thatperson does not exist.This is a shame andit's sad to see,you know two women period youknow of color go through this.So I'm not trying to makelight of this any situationor any joke anything.Greed man.Greed is serious.And not to get religiousbut greed it's spiritualand the things weput in our minds,the things we watch, themusic we listen to influenceand feeds that spirit andthat's just not a good spirit.There's nothing wrong withhaving things and having money,but greed is somethingtotally different.It's idolatry when you put moneybefore your life,other people's lives,you put it before yourrelationship with God,and don't forget it's not moneyis not the root of all evil.It's the love of money.I'm sorry.Bro, I'm disappointedin you, man.You put your life on the line.My life.I'm sorry.You had us in that houseknowing the money was in there.You gave us the keys.Don't tell me you sorry.Tell Unc.You know I never meant foreither of you to get hurt.What more is it to life?I mean what's thepoint of living lifeand then dying broke?Our parents used tohave us sitting upin that room for weekseating those nasty beansjust to afford someprivate school.Some private schoolthat used to mistreat usbecause we were black.I hated that life.I wasn't going back.Cuz, I didn't say that I enjoyedeating those nasty behind beansand I also didn't saythat being broke is okay.I need you to understandthat money is a tool.It's not God.It's all about how we useit not how it uses us.People always get it mixed upthat money is theroot of all evil.No, it's the love of moneythat's the root of all eviland until you understand that,you're never gonna live alife that's worth living.Bull crap.How do you think thatyou're here right now?Luck.Luck?It's because of Godthat you're hereright now this very moment.And until you understand that,you will never fulfillyour life's purpose.Son.I have missed you.
