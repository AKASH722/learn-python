Do you know anyoneat the churchwho needs a babysitteror a part-time nanny?I need a job, and fast.I thought you were busywith the Linenberger twins.I was, but Mrs. Linenbergergot a job transferand they moved this weekend.It was perfect because I couldonly work part-time,and most familiesneed a full-time nanny.I just... I can't do thatwith school.Well, I might havea temp job for you todaylooking afterthis little rascal.What little rascal?The same little rascalthat keeps eatingall my frosting.Danny? Danny!It's never a good thingwhen he's this quiet.Means he's up to no good.Did he get outside?Danny?Danny.Danny?Danny.Danny, you know I don't likethese hide-and-seek gamesyou always play,now show yourself.Is Danny your grandson?I wish I were so lucky.No, his parents arefriends of mine from church.Danny, I am not joking.Now where are you?Gotcha! Hoo-hoo.Scared you good this time.Mm-hm.Danny, you know you're notsupposed to sneak off like that.What would your mother say?She would say scaring peopleisn't a game.I'm sorry, Mrs. Tubbs.Oh, you knowI can't stay mad at you,you little stinkbug.Wow, those are cool shoes.Do they light up when you walk?I'm not supposedto talk to strangers.Oh, this isn't a stranger.This is Delondra.She's gonna look after youwhile I finish baking.Is that okay with you, Danny?Depends. Do you like snakes?I don't like snakes.I love them.Me too.Catch this.Ah! Oh!Think fast.Oh, there's a parkdown the streetI've been dying to check out.Do you wanna go?If that's okay with you.Oh, please. Let him run offsome of that energy.The boy is likea nuclear reactor.He never runs out.Tag, bet you can't catch me.Oh, I bet I can.Hey, why do you like kidsso much?Don't you have friendsyour own age?Yes, but sometimes I thinkkids are more funto be around than adults.I don't want to grow up.Why not?Because adults worry too much,and they always frown,like my dad.Why does your dad frown so much?Hi.Hey. Come on, Danny. Come here.Hey. No. Let go of him!Don't come any closer.What, Mom?We were just playing!Are you okay? Did she hurt you?- No!- You're his mother.Yes, I'm his mother.Melody, no!It's okay.This is the babysitter.Yeah, Mom, don't get mad.She's niceand she likes snakes too.You should have calledand asked my permission.You know how I feel aboutstrangers watching Danny.Oh, she's not a stranger.This is my new tenant.She movedinto the attic apartmentafter Lonnie took offfor Alaska.You must think I'm a terror.No, no, I thinkyou're a good mother.I probably would have reactedthe same way.I'm Delondra Caprez.Melody. Melody Chessman.You have a great son.I've watched a lot of kids,and I can tell the oneswho have good parents.Come on, let's makethis truce officialover some tea or coffee.Come on, kiddo.I'm so sorry I lashed out at youat the park earlier.Stop, it's forgivenand forgotten.Well, there is a reasonthat I reacted so angrily.It's okay,you can tell Delondra.She's good people.What happened?Seven years ago,Danny was kidnapped.He was onlya couple of months old,and he was gone for a weekbefore the police found him.Kidnapped? How?The babysittertook him to the park,and she was attacked.Some terrible monsterjust yanked himout of his baby carriage.I'm still surprisedthat we got him back.They found himat the fire station.I guess the kidnappersdecided that a babywas just too much trouble,and they decided to give him up.Danny still doesn't knowwhat happened to him as a baby.And it's going to stay that way.I want him to grow upfeeling as normal as possibleand feeling safe.They never foundwho took him that day.So when I saw youwith him at the park,someone I don't know...You thought I could have beenthe one who kidnapped him.It's ridiculous, I know.But I still will check on himat least twice every nightwhile he's sleeping justto make sure he's still there.You can trust Delondra.She'll keep him safe.She's a professional.A professional? At what?I'm a nanny.I've been doing it on and offfor the past couple of yearswhile I finish med school.Mm, that's very impressive.And Delondrais currently available,so what do you say?Are you looking for a nanny?Well, my husband and Ihave talked about it.He's been really sick,and I'm busy at work.If it wasn't for Mrs. Tubbs,we would be lost.That boy is wearing me out.You're not gonna find a nannybetter than Delondra.And Danny obviously adores her.I don't know,it's a big commitment.I really needto talk to my husband.Oh, I'll handle Joel.But if it's not Delondra,it's gotta be someone.You need help taking careof Danny while you're at work,and I just can't keep upwith him anymore.Wait, so was todaya job interview?Mm. In a way.Well, when can you start?Right now.I... I just... I can only dopart-time while I'm in school.I'm studying pediatrics.Could she be any more perfect?But don't rushmaking your decision.And I can talkto your husband too.I just... I do need to find a jobrather quickly.No, you don't.You have one if you want it.- For real?- For real.- Hi!- Oh, there he is.Oh, geez!I missed you.Delondra,this is my husband, Joel.- Hi.- Hey, Delondra.Welcome to the family.I hope this little guy hasn'tbeen too much trouble for ya.Only the good kind.Danny.This is wonderful.Do you mind if I share thiswith my friends?No. Let's do it.One, two, three.Now everyone will seewhat a good artist you are.I will not wearyour real diamonds.They're knockoffs.Seriously.Please take them.You're like the younger sisterI never had.I always wanted a big sister.Looks like we both got our wish.Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.Bye, buddy.- Bye. See you.- Bye, Mrs. Tubbs.Bye, honey.I knew she was the right choice.I never thoughtthat I would be comfortablewith anyone who wasn'tone of us watching him.But she's special.Yeah, it's been really nicenot having to worryabout him all the time.We can focus on work,our home, our life.My health is already improving.Yeah, it's likewe can finally exhale.You know how long it's beensince I've been able to do that?About seven years.I'm sorry I doubted you.How can I thank you?As long as y'all are happy,that's all the thanks I need.What do you want to do first?This.Gonna have fun with this.Careful, okay?I will.This is amazing.I love the stuffthat's over here.It's a beautiful day.Hey, uh, will we still befriends when I'm olderand I don't needa nanny anymore?Yeah, you got mefor life, buddy.Pinky swear?Pinky swear.I'll never stopbeing there for youand keeping you safe, okay?That's a promise.And now can we playhide-and-seek again?Again?Yes, again.And I wanna hide firstand you count down from 15.Okay.Okay, I'm gonna start counting.15, 14, 13, 12,11, 10, nine, eight,seven, six, five, four,three, two, one.Ready or not, here I come.Where are you?Okay, you're too good at this.You win the hiding prize.Come on out.Danny?Danny?Danny?Danny?Oh, look, I made a new friend.I've been calling after you.Why haven't you answered?Come on, get off the swing.But I'm still playing.Danny. Right now.Thanks so muchfor keeping him safeuntil I got here.I'm Delondra.I'm so sorry,but we can't stay and play.We gotta go home.Let go of me, you're hurting me.As I lay down to sleep,I pray the Lord my soul to keep.If I die before I wake,I pray the Lord my soul to take.Night, Danny.Sweet dreams.Danny?Do you need some water, buddy?Danny, did you do this?What are you doing here?Did you follow me?You're gonna have to kill mebefore you hurt that little boy.The little boy?Delondra, we're back.Wait, wait, wait,she might hurt you.- Who?- Her!She must have gotten away.Who?A woman from the park earlier.I think she followedDanny and I home.God, Danny.Danny's fine.He's sound asleep.So you noticedany recognizable tattoos,birthmarks, moles,or anything like that?Um, she had a strong smell.Like she hadn't showeredrecently.Hm.And you saidthe first time you saw herwas today at the park?She's probably a vagrant.She followed you home hopingto find some quick cash,which explains why she brokeinto the home office.So you're saying she couldcome back at any point?Not likely.The homeless,they're not career criminalsand they scare easily.Well, do you have enoughinformation to catch her?We'll try.As you know, a lot of break-inshave been happening lately.We'll keep our eyes open,but you guys should do the same.Well, thank you.Yeah.- We appreciate it.- Yeah.Melody, let me help youwith that.You're shaking.Of course I'm shaking.You were almost beaten up,and Danny...Hey. Everything's gonna be okay.No, it won't.She'll come back.The police are gonna handle it.What, like they did the firsttime Danny was kidnapped?If Delondra hadn't been here,then that maniac could havemade off with our son again.Look, Melody, we have no ideaif she's the one who took Dannyseven years ago.Yes, she is.Who else would it be?How's Danny?He's fine,he slept right through it.Oh, thank God.She thinks it was the kidnapper.That's impossible.Why?They never caughtwho took him before.God, I can't go throughthis again.And you're not.Listen, why don'twe just go to bed.- In the morning...- You are not suggestingthat we spendanother night here.I will not stay here another dayand wait for that ladyto come back and take our son.We can't keep moving, okay?This constant relocatingis not healthy for us.It's not healthy for our son.No, I can't sleep here.I won't.Pack up a few things.You're staying with me tonight.And then tomorrow,when you all have cooler heads,we'll figure out next steps.- Yeah.- Okay.I'll help you packDanny's things.Oh, no, we got it.You relax.You've been through enoughtonight.Can I make you something warmto drink?Cocoa always makes me feelbetter in times of stress.You're so good to the Chessmans.Of course I am.Why wouldn't I be?I can't rememberwhether you havea queen or a king-size bedin the guest room.Which linens should I bring?Oh, don't worry about that.I have plenty of linens at home.You know what?Maybe this was justa one-off incident,- terrible but...- No.It was the original kidnapper.I know it in my heart.I just don't understandhow she would find us.We intentionally moveevery two yearsjust so somethinglike this won't happen.And we don't post anythingon social media,so how in the worldwould she find us?Delondra, is something wrong?I posted a photo of Danny.What photo?A photo I postedon social media.- Danny and I.- Are you kidding me?What photo are we talking about?Who gave you permissionto post photos of my son?He's not some toyfor you to use.This is your fault.You're why she found us.I didn't think that...Yeah, you didn't think,just like I didn't thinkwhen I hiredsome stupid med studentto take care of my little boy.Melody, that isn't necessary.You knew how scared I wasto trust youand how afraid I wasthat something like thiswas gonna happen.I thought you were my friend.I am your friend.I'm sorry.Look, it's deleted.And I will never post anythingabout Danny again.That's right, because you'renever gonna see my son again.- You're fired.- Melody!You don't mean that.Because of her,a kidnapper broke into my homeand stolethe happiness and securitythat I've spent the lastseven years trying to regain.I'll go.I'm sorry.I'm sorry I let you down.I'm sorry.I blurred the lines.But they didn't feel likeanother nanny job.Melody, Joel, Danny.Really felt like family.I blew it.I'll get it.No, it's okay, I got it.Hi, I just wanted to stop byand say...Oh, I'm sorry, I can come back.Oh, no, it's all good.I actuallywas just about to leave.I'll see you tonightfor dinner, babe.So sorry about what happened,but I know the policeare gonna find her.Our city's got a good force.Thank you.Wow.You've made this placereally cozy.I remember when this atticwas just a storage space.Oh, I didn't realize you'veknown Mrs. Tubbs for that long.Yes, there was a time whenevershe was the only personthat I could count on.And then you cameinto our lives.Melody, I cannot tell you enoughhow sorry I am about that photo.Well, then let me tell you.I was out of line yesterday.No, you weren't.Will you let mefinish my apology?I just get so scaredthat someone's gonna comeand take Danny again,that I just can't think.And sometimes I saythe worst thingsto the peoplethat I care about the most.It's not much, but I wantedto make it up to you.No, you didn't have to do this.- That's too much.- Oh, it's nothing.It's just someof your favorite cosmeticsand a few otherguilty pleasures.- Still friends?- Of course.And most importantly,will you still be Danny's nanny?Yes.Great.Have the policemade any headway yet?Shh, not in front of Danny.None of us are safeas long as that womanis still out there,and I am not waiting aroundfor the copsto get their act together.Are you leaving?Mrs. Tubbs offered usthe use of her cabin.It's five hoursup in the mountains.It's the only way for meto keep Danny safe.And you too.You want me to come with you?Well, you are still our nanny.And you don't go back to schooluntil the fall, right?Yeah. I mean, I would feel saferbeing away until the copscatch that woman.And we would feel saferhaving you with us.Danny doesn't needany more disruptions.You're one of his new constants.Okay, you got a deal.But I gotta be honest,I am not that greatat the whole camping,outdoors thing.Well, neither am I,and neither is Mrs. Tubbs,which is why her cabinis equipped with TV,internet, and a hot tub.Ooh, are we stayingat a cabin or a spa?Well, after allwe've been through,we all deservea little bit of luxury,but most of all peace of mind.Yeah.Wait, what do you meanyou don't know the addressto where you'll be staying?How am I supposedto know where to sendmy love letters to, babe?Please! You never sent mea love letterthe whole timewe've been together.- What?- I'm lucky if I geta text back.All I get is "Sup" and "K."I mean...It's just because I preferto express my feelingsto you in person.No, but seriously, babe,you sure you're gonna be okayalone in the woods?I'm not gonna be alone,I'm gonna be with the Chessmans.Besides, Danny willkeep me busy enough.Are you sure you're gonnabe okay here alone?I actually fly outfor that finance conferenceup in San Francisco tomorrow.I was kinda hopingyou might come with me,turn into a little mini vacay.I wish,but the Chessmans need me.I mean, it's taken a lot forthem to trust me with Danny.I don't want to let them down.Tell me something.Do all nannies take their jobsas seriously as you do?Only the good ones.I would invite you in,but we're leavingsuper early tomorrow.Nah, it's all good.I understand.But, hey, I guessI just better go aheadand give you this now then.What?Open it.For any close encounterswith wildlifeyou might have up there.Stop.Baby, what's that?Rob!The last thing I needis a bear encounter.If Goldilocks can hold her ownup there in the woods,so can you.Thanks.All right, come on.Give me my good night kiss.All right, be safe.- I will.- Good night.Good night.I don't wanna hurt you.Where is he?Where is the little boy?Will you tell me?Please don't hurt me.I just wanna talk.About Danny?Danny?D-Danny?Hey!

You knowthat little boyyou're taking care ofis my nephew.If your sister really ishis real mother,then why didn't she just tell meinstead of actinglike a crazy person?She broke into my home.Because she's noton her medicine.When Aspen disappeared,her mind cracked right open.Getting him backhas become an obsession.We all tried to convince herit was a lost cause,but when she called me from jailand begged me to find outif what she suspectedwas true...Why are you coming to me?I'm just a nanny.I'm not a police officer.The policewon't help us anymore.My sister has wrongly accusedso many people over the years,they won't take my word or hersseriously anymore.We need proof that little boy...What kind of proof do you need?- DNA evidence.- Please.It's the only way to knowif that little boyreally is my nephew, Aspen.Once I have that proof,then the police will haveto take my claim seriously.What am I supposed to do?Take a sample of his blood?No, just some of his hair.You've really thoughtthis through.I promise I won't make youdo anything else.I'll even pay you.Just a few strands of hairfor the labto compare with his baby hairand see if it's a match.There has to be somebody elsewho can do this.If the DNA isn't a match,then I'll know it's not him.But if there's a chance...I'll make a compromise.I'll call the policeand I'll leave an anonymous tip,and thenChild Protective Serviceswill be legally requiredto investigate.That... that could take weeks.If the Chessmans suspectanyone is on to them,they will flee and I maynever have another chanceto find him again.Please, give mesome of his hair.I'm sorry,it's just too much to ask.You're the only onewho can do this.You owe it to that little boyto give him backto his proper family.There has to be another way.Delondra?Am I interrupting something?No.Yes, but, um...I was, uh, just asking herfor directionsto the best place to fish.Haven't had any luck out here.Yeah, I told himhe was wasting his timebecause I've never been herebefore.Uh, perhaps you knowa good spot.I don't fish.None of us do.Found your basket.Oh, great.I was scared I lost it.Good luck with your fishing.I'll, uh, be out here all nightif you change your mindand want to join me.Nice meeting you.You sure you're okay?Yeah.
