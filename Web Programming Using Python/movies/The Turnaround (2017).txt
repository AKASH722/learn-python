Hallelujah.Now, I want you to help mewelcome a very special guest.Our own Pastor Hutchens.Thank you, pastor.Since you mentioned consequences,let's stay right there.Do y'all know how many timesin the Bible God says hewill visit the sins of afather upon his childrento the third andfourth generation?So, how did youenjoy the sermon?It was food for the spirit.Thank you.

finishthis conversation.No, I gotta be somewherein like 15 minutes.You always have somewhere to go.I just came backto get my phone.Okay, well call me later,I need to see this doctor,but we need to havethis conversation.I have a lot ofquestions for you.I got you.Okay.But don't forget totell Marquise what I said.Girl, I'm gonna tellhim something alright.That's right.Well, the reason werequested for you to come inis because your blood testshows that your RH factoris negative.In all likelihood, yourbaby's RH positive,unless the baby's fatheris RH negative as well.Umm, can we simplifythis a little bit.What does that mean?Basically, being thatyou're RH negative,if your baby is RH positive,your blood could mixwhen you give birth,which would be a problem.What do I need to do next?Can we have the baby'sfather take a blood testto determine ifhe's RH negative?If he is then the baby willbe, and the problem solved.If he's not, then I'llprescribe you some medicationto prevent any problems inthe event that your bloodand the baby's blood wereto mix as you give birth.Me and the father aren'treally on speaking termsright now.Is there any otheroptions for me?Then you may have toget what's called anamniocentesis or AM Test done.This will allow us to see ifthe baby's RH negative as well.The test is relativelysafe with very small chanceof complications, and itallows to screen the babyfor genetic disorders as well.You said a smallchance of complications?Yes, but it's nothingto really worry about.Okay.Hey baby.Baby, what's wrong?Nothing.Well, do you want togo get something to eat?Just take me home, Marquise.Now, you know I'm notleaving until you tell mewhat's wrong, 'cause clearlysomething's bothering you.I heard you've been doingbusiness with your cousin.Is that why you've beenhaving so much money lately?Who told you that?Does it matter?Look, I've been tryingto stack some money up,to build towards having thisfamily that we both want.Okay, so yes, I have beenputting in some work with D-Rock.I don't care aboutthe money, Marquise.Well, you need to.You don't rememberme telling you.I'm a man.As a man, I haveto be a provider.I've seen this storybefore, so I already knowhow it ends.With you either goingto jail or worse, dead.It's not gonna happen.Listen, Marquise, I'm noteven gonna go back and forthwith you, okay, but youhave a decision to make.It's either me or those streets.But you can't have both.Are you being serious right now?I'm serious.Look babe, justrelax, chill alright.I'll tell D-Rock I'm out.Okay?Okay.Thank you.Fine, your makeup about to run.You gonna haveyour dad mad at me.♪ Get readyWho's calling me man?Hello?Pastor Evans?Okay, yeah.Yeah, I gotta just stopby the house first.Okay.♪ Get ready, changeis gonna come♪ He's calling his childrento

the same circumstancesas you.But first you gotta get rightwith God so you can be ableto be that beacon of lightto those still livingin darkness.I don't know about that, pastor.I have enough of my own problemsto worry about as it is.Well, most times in life,we look for the answersto our problems outward,when the answers residewithin us, and thoseanswers come from God.Now, he doesn't alwaysgive you what you want,but he always givesyou what you need.Why don't you stop bytomorrow and give me a handaround here.All I'm asking for is aboutsix hours out of your day.How much did you makeat your last
