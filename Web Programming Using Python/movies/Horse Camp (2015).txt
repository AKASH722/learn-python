Great!Now, wheream I supposedto sleep, hmm?What, I'msupposed to sleepwith Lisa now?Yeah, it's a real picnicfor me, too.Ugh!Okay, so there'stwo categorieswhen itcomes to beingCamp Princess.First of all,you have beenthe best rider.Every year, at the endof summer camp,we have a competition.If you are nominatedfor Camp Princess,you get to go in,and you get to competeand show offall your horse skills.Mr. C and some otherstaff members are gonnabe the ones to judge.Okay. How do Iget nominated?Oh, well,that's the second part.So it's only the nicest girlsthat are eligible,who havethe best camp spirit,and Beth and Ialready nominated you.I did, too.Marissa, just be quiet.Heh. Sorry about her.So anyway, all we neednow is 50 signatures.That seems like a lot.Are you kidding me?You're, like,the most popular girlhere at camp.I could go during free timeand get it all by myself.It'd be so easy.Thank you.There is one thing,though.Stacy's automaticallyalready goingto be competing,because she wasCamp Princess last year,and she'sa pretty good rider.The most important thingis confidence.A horse can feelhow confident a rideris on his backYou know, a lotof horses will tryto push you around,go wherethey want to go,put their head downwhen they eatwheneverthey feel like it,you know,that kind of thing,but you haveto be nice to a horse,but also firm.A lot of the horsesthat would try to pushone of you around,for example,would never even try itwith me on his back.A horse can reallyjust sense the abilityof their rider.Can you passthe cereal, please?Stacy, honey,you reallythink a second bowl'sa good idea?I mean, I know thingshaven't been going greatfor you lately,but you can't eatyour way to happiness.Just remember,a moment on the lips,forever on the hips.I'm gonnago see Mosesand the otherminiature horsesat free time todayif you want to come.Yeah, sounds good.Sure.Oh. It's just that,you know,you haven't seen Mosesin a really long time,and he's gonna...Yeah, okay, Lisa,I said yes, so...Anyway, what wasI talking about?Horses can sensewho's riding them.Right, okay.So take Sundance,for example.He won'tlet anyone elseride him,but whenI'm on his back,he becomesa perfect littlepeace horse.Hi, Miss Tara.Hey, Lisa.Where's Kathy?She'll be herein a few minutes.Two peas in a pod.Yeah, I guess.Trouble in paradise?No. I don't even knowwhy I said that.Moses is lookingreally old.Yeah, he is.He's...He's what?Nothing. I can't talkabout it with campers.I'm only a few yearsyounger than you, Tara.It's Miss Tara,and that's true,but you'restill a camper,and I'm stilla counselor, so...Fine.I'm glad you're here,actually.I wanted to talk to youabout something.Oh, yeah? What's that?Camp Princess.It's either gonnabe Kathy or Stacy,so I don't know whatthere is to talk about.What about you?What about me?As Camp Princess.Heh heh.Yeah, right.I'm serious.Okay, well,let's start here.I'm an average riderat best,so even ifI could get nominated,I wouldn't getthe riding competition part.I have a theory,actually.Why do I thinkI'm gonna hear about this?I don't thinkMr. C judgeson the best rider.When his dad startedthe camp competitionyears ago,he did it to honorthe girl who bestrepresents Black River.Yeah, we're herefor the horsesof course,but that's not allthat camp's about.You make peoplefeel welcome, Lisa.You're kindto everybody.You should beour Camp Princess.Yeah, well, thank you,but I don't thinkI quite fit the moldfor the signatures.I doubt 50 girls hereeven know my name.Never knowtill you try.Yeah.Where is Kathy?I don't know.She's late.He's got somethingright here, too.Come on.You got this.All right.Good! Good job!Good job.All right.Really good.Oh, hey.Oh, hey.Which one of theseshirts do you thinkI should wear tonight?I don't know.Hold 'em up higher.Doesn't help.Neither of 'emhave the slogan"Leaves best friend behindall day by herself"written in big words.What are youtalking about?We were supposedto spend free hour todaywith the miniature horses.We were?Yep.When did we talkabout that?At breakfast.I don't remember that.Okay.Well, can youremember this?Tomorrow we'regonna go riding,just you and melike we used to, okay?Okay, yeah.Sounds fun.I won't forget.I promise.Now, will you help mepick out a shirt?Definitely the blue one.Yeah?Yes.I pledge allegianceto the flagof the United Statesof Americaand to the republicfor which it stands,one nation under God,indivisible,with libertyand justice for all.You ready?Yeah, but where'syour saddle?I'm gonna ridebareback today.I don't thinkthat's a very good idea.I've been ridingfor a long time, Kathy.Yeah, but...What,I'm not as goodas a rider as you?That wasn'twhat I was gonna say.It's true, though.I've beenriding every summerfor the last nine years,and thisis your first summer,and you'reso much betterthan I am.Lisa, it's nota competition.Isn't it, though?Camp Princess,isn't it a competition?Lisa.Look, I'm sorry.Let's just ridelike we used to, okay?What should I dofor the talent shownext year?What do you mean "I"?Me, Kathy,what should I dofor the talent show?You're gonna do our cabin'snext talent showall by yourself?Okay, what should we dofor the talent shownext year?What do you mean "we"?I don't thinkI understand.Well, last time,you didn't include me.It's not like that,Lisa.Well,what's it like, then?I mean, talent showis just kind ofnot your thing.Well, I wouldn't know,because you didn'tinclude me last time,and youexcluded Stacy, too.Since when do youcare about Stacy?Stacy is a camperat Black River,and I care aboutall the campers here.But she was never niceto you, Lisa.Maybe not, but Iwas always nice to her,and I was always niceto you, too.I know.Do you?'Cause forthe last three weeks,you haven't beenthat nice to me.Well, maybeyou're just jealous.What was that?I saidyou're just jealous.Yeah, that must be it.Look, do youwant me to say it?Fine!
